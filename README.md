#Front end projects by codersuresh

https://codersuresh.github.io

Here is the collection of all front end projects done by me (codersuresh) till this day (as a learning part). I want you to view those projects and give feedback to me so that I can improve my projects. 

Some of the projects are responsive and some are static (tested on laptop screen of resolution 1366x768)

You are free to use those codes in your projects.
